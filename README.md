# justparty

just live. just love. justParty. 

Every time you plan a great party you forget something? You don’t find the perfect date? Some of your friends don’t like the music? Everything seems to go wrong?

All of your problems will be solved soon!

We – a team of three students from the Cooperative State University in Karlsruhe – have just started working on a web-based tool which will make it as easy as you can imagine to plan your party.

Next we want to tell you something about the features of the tool:

Make a distinction between different kinds of events (private, public, wedding, birthday, …)

An Assistant will guide you through the planning of your event

You’ll get references to useful external services

Create an event on Facebook, Google+ and in diverse other Calendars

Invite all of your friends via E-Mail, Facebook and Google+

Print invitations for your friends with one click

Choose a date and a location together

Divide preparations

Plan who will bring what to your party

Share an amazon Wish List

Allow music requests and/or create a shared Spotify Playlist

Share photos of your Party afterwards with all your Friends

All Settings can be chosen collaboratively

We do not know yet, wether we will be able to implement all of these features within this project. However, we may be thinking about continuing this projekt as a permanent programm afterwards, will see…

If you have any idea from which this project could benefit from – let us know in the comment section below! :)

In this blog we will regularly publish news and information about this project: https://tohemidevelopment.wordpress.com/
